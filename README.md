TazBot
======

TazBot is a Questions and Answers Bot written to serve the users in the official SliTaz IRC channel on freenode.
It's pretty simple to use and it's answers database can be expanded on the fly using the same learning system as used by QBot and Alia. What sets TazBot apart from the other two is the use of the 'help' and 'topics' paramaters which tell the user both bow to use TazBot and which questions the bot is like to answer.
